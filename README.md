# UAV package delivery for urban air mobility (UAM)

## Introduction

This project focuses on simulating a package delivery system utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The primary objective is to employ the A* algorithm to determine an optimal, obstacle-free path from point A to point B for the UAVs within urban environments. The aim is to expedite the delivery process and maximize the number of deliveries within a specified timeframe in UAM operations.

## Setup

### Step 1: Save Maps
Save your maps - with or without obstacles in STL format - under `UAVPathPlanning/Maps`.

### Step 2: Map Data Loading

#### Case 1 - Load New Map Data
1. Open `RunAll.m` under `UAVPathPlanning/AlgoStuff`.
2. Set the variable `map` to the name of your map as in `map = ".\Maps\manhattan.stl";`.
3. If you'd like obstacles in your simulation:
    - Specify the name of your map that has obstacles to the variable `mapObstacles`.
    - Set `enableObstacles` to `True`.
    Otherwise, set `enableObstacles` to `False`.
4. Open `VariableConfig.m` under `UAVPathPlanning/AlgoStuff`.
    - Set the `startPose` and `goalPose` for the A* algorithm and for the UAV starting and destination points, respectively (e.g., `startPose = [meters, meters, radians]`).
5. Execute `RunAll.m` script to start the simulation.
6. (Optional) You may want to save your 2D occupancy map data for future use (see Case 2).

#### Case 2 - Use Saved Map Data
Note: This step assumes you have completed Case 1 or you are using our testing data.
1. Open `Root.m` under `UAVPathPlanning/AlgoStuff`.
2. Follow steps 2 and 3 from Case 1. This time, the changes are made in `Root.m`.
3. Repeat step 4 from Case 1, but make the changes in `VariableConfiguration.m`.
4. Execute the `Root.m` script to start the simulation.

## Results

After completing either Case 1 or Case 2 in Setup, use the `SaveData.m` file to save the trajectory the path followed. Next, open `Testing.py` under `UAVPathPlanning/Testing` to find the accuracy of the UAV's trajectory relative to the expected path generated by the A* algorithm. This step required you have Python installed.
