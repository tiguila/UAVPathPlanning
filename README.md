# UAV package delivery for urban air mobility (UAM)

## Introduction

This project focuses on simulating a package delivery system utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The primary objective is to employ the A* algorithm to determine an optimal, obstacle-free path from point A to point B for the UAVs within urban environments. The aim is to expedite the delivery process and maximize the number of deliveries within a specified timeframe in UAM operations.
